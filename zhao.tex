%Diagram showing equivalences between different fixpoint concepts used in economics
%Solid lines signify known results, dashed lines signify open problems
%Some of these open problems may have been solved since Zhao's paper, however.

%TO DO: try adding white circles between overlapping lines -- may make it look more professional
